# Memory-game
## Overview
The Memory Game is a classic card-matching game where players flip over pairs of cards to find matches. This implementation includes a dynamic game board, score tracking, and smooth animations for card flipping.

## Features
- **Dynamic Board**: A 5x6 grid of cards with random placement for every new game.
- **Match Logic**: Cards stay revealed if they match; otherwise, they flip back.
- **Animations**: Smooth flip animations for revealing and hiding cards.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the number of steps and matches found.
- **Reset Functionality**: Start a new game with shuffled cards at any time.

## How to Play
1. Click on any two cards to reveal them.
2. If the cards match, they will remain revealed.
3. If the cards do not match, they will flip back after clicking another card.
4. Continue until all pairs are matched.
5. The game ends when all cards are matched, and an alert will notify the player.
